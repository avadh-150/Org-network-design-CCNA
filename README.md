Scalable Enterprise Network Design (Packet Tracer): Built a secure, Layer 3 network with 12 VLANs, OSPF for routing, and static core IPs. Features include inter-VLAN routing, hierarchical subnetting, port security, and WPA2 wireless access control for seamless departmental communication.

1️⃣ Basic Settings – Configured hostname, banner, passwords, SSH, and secure access on all routers and switches.
2️⃣ VLAN Implementation – Created and assigned 12 VLANs for Management, IT, HR, Admin, Logistic, Finance, Sales, Store, Reception and Admin divisions. 
3️⃣ Switchport Security – Enabled port security across all access switches to prevent unauthorized access. 
4️⃣ IP Addressing & Subnetting – Implemented hierarchical subnetting for each department with clear addressing schemes. 
5️⃣ Dynamic Routing (OSPF) – Configured OSPF across routers with  efficient route advertisement and redundancy.
6️⃣ Static IPs – Assigned static IPs to core device . 
7️⃣ Inter-VLAN Routing – Achieved full communication between all VLANs through routing configurations. 
9️⃣ Wireless Network Setup – Configured access points for each department (with WPA2-PSK authentication for secure Wi-Fi access. 
🔟 Verification & Testing – Successfully tested connectivity between departments, verified 
 inter-VLAN reachability using ping commands. 💡

This is Core Network Design where whole organization or company must have.

Tools Used: 🧰 Cisco Packet Tracer 📶 Routers (2911), Switches (2960, 3650), Wireless Access Points

Outcome: The network supports seamless communication between all departments, secure access control, efficient routing, and  IP allocation — replicating the design of a real-world enterprise network.
